This artifact works on Windows, Intel/Apple Silicon Macs, and Linux systems running Intel processors.
We have not tested on systems with AMD processors, but have no reason to believe there would be any issues.

In terms of software requirements, the user must have:
1. A Python executable of at least version 3.9.
2. A working Docker installation.
3. An Internet connection.

Running our full experiments takes tens of thousands of machine hours, so we have provided instructions on how to run 
a small subset of experiments and read/interpret the results.
