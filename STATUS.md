We are applying for the Functional, Reusable, and Available badges.

We believe we deserve the Available badge because our artifact is available on Zenodo for long-term archiving, as well as on GitHub where we continue to make patches and fix bugs.

We believe we deserve the Functional badge because our artifact can be executed and used to test static analysis tools. Our README.md file gives guidance on how to run the experiments in our paper.

We believe we deserve the Reusable badge because our artifact is easily extensible as demonstrated by the comprehensive documentation as well as the video example which demonstrates how one would integrate new tools/benchmarks.
